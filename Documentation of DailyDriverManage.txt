			Introduction of Project 
I am using NetBeans IDE 12.4 . And I created a Java SE application project using name "DailyDriverManage". And it generated a file with "DailyDriverManage.java" which is the main file. After created i needed a jFrame window. Because we need a Gui interface so, we can input and output data and show tables. So, i give this JFrame name as "MainFrame". Now, I wanted to run this JFrame as Gui interface. So, I add codes about running this MainFrame in "DailyDriverManage.java" Main function.

	
			Design of MainFrame
For the "Time" input field is one spinner box. And used custom codes.
Then I created a Table with those fileds text.
After the fields I created buttons.

Now for the Stage 3 i had to design a system where it will show like that output. So, I created with Textboxes for total summury and under those a table and placed those left side of that main table. And then gave the name to all buttons. And then created a class. And gave the name:"Functionalities". And then I created a inserting code there. Which input the inserted values in the main table and in the second table. After done the Maintable inserting code in that Functionalities.java i added it after click on insert button. Now for the same goes for the second Table. For this i have made two methods. First it check if the Driver Id is inserted before or not. Then if not then it will create a new row. And if it already was then it will be summing with new data.

Now for the total info above that second Table. I made another function in the Functionalities.java. Called "TotalCount". After done the code. I setted it into the Insert Button code. Now there left for selcting from the table and cancel button. And the Saving button. So, First I did for selecting method. when we click on any cell. Of this row all will be retrieve into those Boxes. Now I coded for Cancel Button. What it does is if i change anything in the texboxes. Then it will reset all the changes. Now only left for saving. And then coded in the Save Button. Here these are done for basic working.

For the Stage 4. For these Driver's ID and Amount. I coded in both of those KeyTyped event. And for the Driver's ID it only takes numbers. And does not take any dot(.). So i have used checking method of typed char if that is digit or not. And the Amount Field takes both.

For the Stage 5. I coded for loading csv file. First it let the select the file. And then we get the filepath.So, after that we used a basic BufferedReader to read that file using that selected filepath. Added the rows in both tables. And also coded for the total. Now for the outputing as csv file. For that I coded in export Button. For the exporting the csv i made a boolean function in the Functionalities.java . And for the choosing folder to savepath i used showSaveDialog for JFileChooser. After get the save path then execute saving code with that path and the table. After the saved it shows a messagebox said "Saved csv to " that path.

For the Stage 6. I go to Services bar. And then connected the Java DB. And then created a database as "DailyDriverManage". And gave the username and password both as "root" And there created a table called "DailyDriver". And then inserted all the boxes names there. After created the Table.Then i created a new class for Database connecting, inserting and others. And gave the name "DBclass.java". Then coded for connection. And then in the mainpage i codded for make a Connection variable. And then codded in the DBclass.java for loading function. And then added after the initializing in MainFrame.java. Now. If i insert any row in the database table then after rerun the app i can see the changes. And even if i close this and rerun the database will not go again. Now I have to setup for Inserting. So, I created a new function called "insert" in the DBclass. After coded I added this function to  the inserted code in the Functionalities.java. Now, I can insert and these are saving to database forever. Now there i have to do for saving/updating code. So for that i added the updated code inside the DBclass.java. And named it as "Update". But to do this we need a specific id so we can get the right data. So, I made a Integer field in the database and in the table. and named it as "Serial". And then i made a serialcount in the Mainwindow.java code. Every time any thing inserting then it +1. After the update code and done those fixes then I needed for to code for loading the Second table. After I did it then I inserted 20 journeys and four drivers. Now if i close and re run again then it will popup the datas again. So, this means it is done.
